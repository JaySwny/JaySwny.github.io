                <p class="P">
                I'm Jay, a passionate and curious Cyber Security and Networks student with a strong interest in machine 
                learning, IoT and digital Security. I am finishing up my studies at <b>Glasgow Caledonian University</b> 
                and looking for employment following my graduation in July 2025. 
                <br><br>
                During my time at university, I've had the chance to work on a wide range of projects, from ethical hacking and 
                penetration testing to system and network configuration, as well as server hardening. These experiences have
                given me hands-on familiarity with a variety of tools and techniques, and helped me build a strong technical foundation.
                                
                
                <br><br>
                Outside of tech, I've worked in fast-paced customer-facing roles that taught me how to stay calm under 
                pressure, work as part of a team, and communicate clearly. I'm now looking for a role where I can apply 
                my technical skills and problem-solving mindset while continuing to grow and learn professionally.

        <h2 class="subtitle"> Investigating how Federated Learning can enhance the security, Efficiency and Accuracy in IoT environments </h2>
     <h3 class="Topic-title">Honours Project </h3>

        <div class="text-block">
        
           <p class="P">               
                My Honours project was an investigation into how gradient quantization can improve the scalability, 
                efficiency, and security of federated learning in resource-constrained IoT environments. The project 
                evaluates the performance of a shallow 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) trained on non-IID 
                partitions of the CICIDS2017 dataset, simulating real-world intrusion detection tasks across multiple 
                IoT clients. Techniques like stochastic quantization are applied to compress gradient updates, 
                aiming to reduce communication overhead without significantly impacting model accuracy. The system is 
                implemented using TensorFlow and Flower, with metrics such as accuracy, training time, and communication 
                size logged for analysis. The goal is to identify quantization strategies that enable practical, secure 
                federated learning deployments in low-power IoT devices.

        <h2 class="subtitle-proj"> Security Assessment of a Simulated Chemical Plant ICS </h2>
        <h3 class="Topic-title">Cyber Physical System :  Coursework</h3>

         <div class="text-block">

           <p class="P">
                This project provided a security assessment of a simulated chemical plant's industrial control system. I 
                aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the ICS and assess the system's resilience to a range of cyberattacks.
                The evaluation process includes building an asset inventory through network scanning and traffic analysis, 
                identifying and profiling ICS devices, and performing targeted vulnerability assessments and attacks, such as 
                a perception layer compromise and a man-in-the-middle attack.

        <h2 class="subtitle-proj"> Secure System Administration Project: Secure Linux Server Setup </h2>
        <h3 class="Topic-title">Secure Systems Administration :  Coursework</h3>

         <div class="text-block">

           <p class="P">
                This project involved installing and securing a CentOS 7 Linux server in a virtualized environment. 
                The goal was to configure a secure and functional server setup with a static IP, hardened SSH access, 
                and firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access. Key steps included installing the OS using VirtualBox, 
                setting up user accounts and directory permissions, configuring a static IP address, securing SSH by 
                disabling root login and changing the default port, and implementing firewall rules using firewall-cmd. 
                The project also involved creating bash scripts and using SELinux tools to ensure secure remote access and 
                user management.
